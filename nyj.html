          Born A Crime To establish the scene to understand his country's
          history and how it influences the present, Noah introduces and
          describes the prominent tribes of South Africa before going into any
          detail about his own life. As he compares and contrasts the traits of
          the Zulu and Xhosa people, he also establishes the context for the
          talks that will come about his family members, Patricia, his mother,
          and his grandmother. This background material clarifies Patricia's
          complete Xhosa heritage and explains the turbulent nature of her
          relationship with Zul. Trevor's relationship with his mother, who is
          very important to his family because he doesn't see his father very
          often. It is made abundantly evident how she stood up for him all the
          time despite the apartheid regime's regulations. 
          <p class="p">
            Trevor describes his
            experiences growing up in Soweto, where he describes the difficulties
            he encountered as a member of multiple racial classes, which
            frequently made him feel different from other black children and
            members of the white population. Trevor shows us how dedicated his
            family was to Christianity and how the white people introduced
            Christianity to them. This applies to my country, where we adopted
            Christianity with the arrival of the White people in place of our
            previous traditional beliefs. In connection with my country, we
            witness many tribes and cultures using the strategy of divide and
            conquer to seize power, much like what happened in South Africa.
            Additionally, we witness recurring themes of family and resiliency,
            which are prevalent in my county. Another important factor is family:
            Patricia does everything in her power to protect Trevor.
